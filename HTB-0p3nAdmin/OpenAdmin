The name of Machine is OPenAdmin

Given ip is 10.10.10.171  

The ports that we got after nmap scan is 22 and 80 

We first start with port 80 .

Doing dirsearch on port 80, 


We get a folder /music . 

Lets see whats in it and lets try to enumerate beyond music 

We find /music/img and /music/css


We are able to get the folder ona which is open net admin 

From there , i get the archive.tar.gz and we extract it 


We get a list of files and one of them is a config file to the db 

db-login = ona_sys
db_passwd = n1nj4W4rri0R!
db database = ona-default 


Tried the credentials on jimmy and joanna in ssh 

Jimmy worked !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We are inside jimmy 

Now after a peek , 

We enumerate to the internal page inside the /var/www and find a important main page 
giving us access to the private key of ssh of joanna

So we tried curl on localhost 

However no page was found 

Then netstat -tulpn was done , to find the ports listening .

Trying a port among one of those , gave the id_rsa

GEtting the id_rsa , getting its hash and giving it to john .

We get the password bloodninjas

Now we try logging in joanna , but it doesnt work

as we need the rsa key too

ssh -i id_rsa user@ip

in joanna , 

we get user.txt

Now we see /bin/nano /opt/priv 

We can include any file in the nano 

So we edited the /etc/passwd file and added a new user .

* does not work as empty passwd 

WVLY0mgH0RtUI this is a hash for mrcake password 

and we got root
