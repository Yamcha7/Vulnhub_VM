On netdiscover we got the ip 

The ip gives us ports 

port 22
port 8080 


enumerating the directories we got some sensitive directories 

/axis2/axis2-web/index.jsp

The login we got at http://192.168.0.8:8080/axis2/axis2-admin/welcome?failed=true 

axis service 

tried using default credentials 

The username is admin and the password is axis2

We get access to one service .

Another service lied at the manager/html where default credentials tomcat and tomcat worked 

We uploaded a jsp reverse shell from metasploit and got the user tomcat 


However we checked sudo and found tomcat to have no passwd sudo for java execution 


We created another reverse shell for java in jar 

Downloaded in the victim using wget and ran it from the sudo java


To get root at the other end 

Best of Luck
